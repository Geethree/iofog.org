# Get To Know ioFog

In this step of the tutorial we'll better familiarize ourselves with the ioFog environment [we just set up](introduction.html) in the previous step and `iofogctl`.

## Check Your Environment

You can have a comprehensive view of your Edge Cloud Network (ECN) and the running docker containers by using our `./status.sh` shell script.

```bash
$ ./status.sh
```

Or you can manually verify that the ioFog stack containers are correctly started. Note that it may take a minute or two for ioFog to start the tutorial microservices. The output should look like the following.

```console
$ iofogctl get all

```

We can also see that in the PORTS column some of these containers have published [port mappings](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/):

For example, there's a microservice running an instance of [Freeboard](https://github.com/Freeboard/freeboard), an open source visualization dashboard for IoT devices. It's running a web server that serves the dashboard. Go ahead and try it out at http://localhost:10102/?load=dashboard.json

The Freeboard microservice doesn't know it's running locally, so it could just as well be running on real edge node hardware!

## ioFog Containers

Our tutorial environment has three ioFog containers:

- iofog-agent (see [Agents](../agents/overview.html))
- iofog-controller (see [Controller](../controllers/overview.html))
- iofog-connector (see [Connector](../connectors/overview.html)

We can think of each of these containers as if they were deployed on separate devices. In production, our Controller is most often running on a cloud server and our Agents are each running on individual edge hardware nodes in the field. The Controller is controlling the Agent the same way it would if the devices were hundreds of miles away, and the Connector can broker communication between any microservices we run.

To interact with our containers we can use the [`docker exec -ti`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/) command.

### Iofogctl vs component CLIs

We are currently in the process of migrating all our management system into one tool to rule them all: `iofogctl` !

However, this process is still ongoing and eventhough you can do everything you need for this tutorial (and much more...) in iofogctl, you must know that every ioFog component (Agent, Controller, and Connector) has its local CLI (iofog-agent, iofog-controller, and iofog-connector) that can prove itself usefull.

#### Agent's Container

Let's start by using `iofogctl` to retrieve a detailed description of our Agent.

```console
$ iofogctl describe agent local-agent

uuid: xPqLmbQxXpZj6VbTZMcTDbbBgCNLyhkR
name: local-agent

```

Let's see how we can use the `iofog-agent` CLI to find out its status. Note that the first `iofog-agent` in the following command stands for the container name, and the second `iofog-agent` is the executable wrapped in the container.

```console
$ docker exec -ti iofog-agent iofog-agent status

ioFog daemon                : RUNNING
Memory Usage                : about 304.26 MiB

System Available Memory     : 862.21 MB
System Total CPU            : 1.30 %
```

There's also `iofog-agent info`, used to view this Agent's settings:

```console
$ docker exec -ti iofog-agent iofog-agent info

Iofog UUID                               : xPqLmbQxXpZj6VbTZMcTDbbBgCNLyhkR

#### Controller's Container

Let's list all the configured ioFog nodes using `iofogctl`.

```console
$ iofogctl get agents

NAMESPACE
default

AGENT		STATUS		AGE		    UPTIME		IP		        VERSION
local-agent	RUNNING		1h26m		1h25m		91.178.63.198	1.3.0


```

Now, let's try listing all the preconfigured ioFog nodes using the Controller CLI.

```console
$ docker exec -ti iofog-controller iofog-controller iofog list
{
  "fogs": [
    {
      "lastActive": 1568371373399,
      "daemonOperatingDuration": 5312950,
      "daemonLastStart": 1568366050335,
      "systemAvailableDisk": 46123114496,
      "systemAvailableMemory": 890736640,
      "repositoryCount": 2,
      "systemTime": 1568371324278,
      "lastStatusTime": 1568371365808,
      "processedMessages": 149610,
      "messageSpeed": 86,
      "lastCommandTime": 0,
      "logFileCount": 10,
      "uuid": "xPqLmbQxXpZj6VbTZMcTDbbBgCNLyhkR",
      "name": "local-agent",

...
```

This should give us a JSON response containing a list of edge nodes already registered with the Controller. In our case we should get a single node, `"name": "local-agent"`. This "node" is the container environment of iofog-agent. Remember that in production, instead of being containers running locally on our machine, these nodes would be real edge hardware as part of our Edge Compute Network (ECN), where our microservices run.

## Manage Our Microservices

Now that we know our way around a bit, let's learn how to manage and launch microservices!
