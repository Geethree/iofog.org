# Deploy Your Microservice

In this step we'll learn how to deploy our newly created microservice to our ioFog tutorial environment.

## Register Your Docker Image

With our Docker image from the previous step in hand, it's time to publish it to a [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/).

While you can use a custom registry (or the public [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)), the Controller also comes with a built-in private registry that represents the local cache on the ioFog edge compute nodes.

To get a list of the container registries, we can use `registry list`:

```bash
docker exec -it iofog-controller iofog-controller registry list
```

You should see two, the first being [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), but we're going to use the second one, which is the built-in private registry:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "url": "from_cache",
  "isPublic": true,
  "isSecure": true,
  "certificate": "",
  "requiresCert": false,
  "username": "",
  "userEmail": "",
  "userId": null
}
```

The unique ID for the built-in registry is always `2`.

Now that we have that registry ID, we can use it to add our Docker image to its catalog. We'll provide `iofog-tutorial/moving-average:v1` as the x86-image of our microservice:

```bash
$ docker exec -it iofog-controller \
    iofog-controller catalog add \
    --name "Moving Average" \
    --x86-image lkrcal/moving-average:v1 \
    --registry-id 2 \
    --user-id 1
```

This command will return a catalog ID that we'll use in the next step, in this case it is `105`.

## Add Your Microservice

Now that the Docker image containing our microservice code is registered, we can spin up new copies of it also using the Controller.

Instantiating a new microservice is done using the `microservice add` command. We need to provide several options, the most notable being the catalog ID we received in the previous section as well as a node UUIDâ€”which is the UUID of the edge node we want this microservice to run on.

So let's find the UUID for the first Agent with the name "Agent 1":

```bash
docker exec -ti iofog-controller iofog-controller iofog list
```

In our case, the default agent has a UUID of `vH6vfNzLwHK483CwHRJyyPZtNZ2m46zC`. Using that UUID together with the reference to the catalog, we can pass it and our other arguments to instantiate the microservice. This is also a great opportunity to include our custom config for our `maxWindowSize`.

```bash
docker exec -it iofog-controller \
    iofog-controller microservice add \
    --name "Moving Average" \
    --catalog-id 105 \
    --config '{ "maxWindowSize": 10 }' \
    --iofog-uuid vH6vfNzLwHK483CwHRJyyPZtNZ2m46zC \
    --flow-id 1 \
    --user-id 1
```

This command will return the microservice UUID, which we'll then use in the next step to setup our routes. In our case, the returned UUID of hte microservice is `ydmtBFxJhxvVgLKfM2qLPj4KtcVgdg23`.

## Setup Our Routes

With the microservice UUID from the last step, let's change our routes so that our new microservice is placed between the Sensors and the REST API.

First, let's remove the old route from the Sensors to the REST API. We need to retrieve the microservice UUIDs for Sensors and the REST API:

```bash
docker exec -ti iofog-controller iofog-controller microservice list
```

Example output can look like this. Note that many attributes are not shown in this output, but we can clearly see all the UUIDs and routes.
```json
{
  "microservices": [
    {
      "name": "Sensors",
      "uuid": "PDRRQcbD6DVZJy9QBJQB7JyzH7RgLJCb",
      "catalogItemId": 102,
      "iofogUuid": "vH6vfNzLwHK483CwHRJyyPZtNZ2m46zC",
      "routes": [
        "NZp8HZ7xpztPyC4dpRQx4w3Jd8x9jNF3"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Rest API",
      "uuid": "NZp8HZ7xpztPyC4dpRQx4w3Jd8x9jNF3",
      "catalogItemId": 103,
      "iofogUuid": "vH6vfNzLwHK483CwHRJyyPZtNZ2m46zC",
    },
    {
      "name": "Freeboard",
      "uuid": "BrKHZf9PTcT6yjKcrpnRVBcYPFqxqXxb",
      "catalogItemId": 104,
      "iofogUuid": "vH6vfNzLwHK483CwHRJyyPZtNZ2m46zC",
    },
    {
      "name": "Moving Average",
      "uuid": "ydmtBFxJhxvVgLKfM2qLPj4KtcVgdg23",
      "config": "{ \"maxWindowSize\": 10 }",
      "catalogItemId": 105,
      "iofogUuid": "vH6vfNzLwHK483CwHRJyyPZtNZ2m46zC",
    }
  ]
}
```

After finding those two UUIDs in the list, provide the Sensors UUID and API UUID separated by a semicolon.
```bash
docker exec -ti iofog-controller \
    iofog-controller microservice route-remove \
        --route PDRRQcbD6DVZJy9QBJQB7JyzH7RgLJCb:NZp8HZ7xpztPyC4dpRQx4w3Jd8x9jNF3
```

Now we need to place two new routes: one from the Sensors to Moving Average, and another from Moving Average to the REST API; this places our new microservice in between them.

```bash
docker exec -ti iofog-controller \
    iofog-controller microservice route-create \
        --route PDRRQcbD6DVZJy9QBJQB7JyzH7RgLJCb:ydmtBFxJhxvVgLKfM2qLPj4KtcVgdg23
        
docker exec -ti iofog-controller \
    iofog-controller microservice route-create \
        --route ydmtBFxJhxvVgLKfM2qLPj4KtcVgdg23:NZp8HZ7xpztPyC4dpRQx4w3Jd8x9jNF3
```

The new configuration of microservices should look like this:

```json
{
  "microservices": [
    {
      "name": "Sensors",
      "uuid": "PDRRQcbD6DVZJy9QBJQB7JyzH7RgLJCb",
      "catalogItemId": 102,
      "iofogUuid": "vH6vfNzLwHK483CwHRJyyPZtNZ2m46zC",
      "routes": [
        "ydmtBFxJhxvVgLKfM2qLPj4KtcVgdg23"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Rest API",
      "uuid": "NZp8HZ7xpztPyC4dpRQx4w3Jd8x9jNF3",
      "catalogItemId": 103,
      "iofogUuid": "vH6vfNzLwHK483CwHRJyyPZtNZ2m46zC",
    },
    {
      "name": "Freeboard",
      "uuid": "BrKHZf9PTcT6yjKcrpnRVBcYPFqxqXxb",
      "catalogItemId": 104,
      "iofogUuid": "vH6vfNzLwHK483CwHRJyyPZtNZ2m46zC",
    },
    {
      "name": "Moving Average",
      "uuid": "ydmtBFxJhxvVgLKfM2qLPj4KtcVgdg23",
      "config": "{ \"maxWindowSize\": 10 }",
      "catalogItemId": 105,
      "iofogUuid": "vH6vfNzLwHK483CwHRJyyPZtNZ2m46zC",
      "routes": [
        "NZp8HZ7xpztPyC4dpRQx4w3Jd8x9jNF3"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<aside class="notifications danger">
  <h3><img src="/images/icos/ico-danger.svg" alt=""> Known issue - Agent deletes moving average image!</h3>
  <p>When you update the routes for the moving average microservice, ioFog agent re-creates the containers, but due to a known issue, also deletes the underlying image. In order for the moving average image to start correctly, you need to build it again.</p>
</aside>

Finally, for the moment of truth. Let's first try a curl request to our REST API.

```bash
curl http://0.0.0.0:10101/
```

If everything is working correctly, the JSON returned should be our new moving averages and contain our `"isAverage": true` field we added.

We can also open up the [Freeboard dashboard](http://localhost:10102/?load=dashboard.json) to view the averaged values! Note that `?load=dashboard.json` in the URL loads a predefined dashboard for this tutorial. The dashboard definition is already part of the Freeboard container.

## Update a Microservice

Once a microservice is up and running you will probably need to modify it later, which we can also do with the Controller.

The `microservice update` command is used to update a particular microservice. We can easily update the configuration of our moving average microservice.

```bash
docker exec -ti iofog-controller \
    iofog-controller microservice update \
        --microservice-uuid ydmtBFxJhxvVgLKfM2qLPj4KtcVgdg23 \
        --config '{ "maxWindowSize": 100 }'
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've now have the fundamentals of ioFog. Once you're feeling more comfortable you can create a blank [Development Environment](../gettings-started/quick-start.html) locally, or start setting up [ioFog in production](../getting-started/setup-your-controllers.html).
